Ecuadorian Quinoa and Vegetable Soup

Serves 4 to 6

Quinoa, an ancient grain whose recorded use dates back to the Incan Empire, has been rediscovered in recent years as another delicious option in the grain family. Quinoa has a mild nutty flavor and crunchy texture; is rich in vitamins, minerals, and amino acids; and cooks in about 15 minutes. Here, it thickens a soup made of other crops indigenous to the Americas: potatoes, squash, peppers, and tomatoes.

1/2 cup raw quinoa
2 Tbs. olive oil
2 cups chopped onions
1 tsp. salt
1 cup diced potatoes
1 cup chopped red or green bell peppers
1 tsp. ground coriander
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
3 cups water or vegetable stock
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh or undrained canned tomatoes (14_-ounce can)
1 cup diced zucchini or yellow squash
1 Tbs. fresh lemon juice

Optional garnishes: Chopped scallions, chopped fresh cilantro, crumbled tortilla chips, and/or grated Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese

Thoroughly rinse the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water to remove bitter coating. Set aside to drain.

Warm the oil in a nonreactive soup pot, add the onions and salt, cover, and cook on medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the drained quinoa, potatoes, bell peppers, coriander, cumin, oregano, black pepper, water or stock, and tomatoes. Cover and bring to a boil; then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Add the zucchini, cover, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until all of the vegetables are tender.

Stir in the lemon juice. If desired, serve with a sprinkling of scallions, cilantro, tortilla chips, and/or grated cheese.
